                    <div class="step-description">
                        <p>The first step in the build process was to decide the components in the receiver and wand as well as how they would communicate. Our requirements called for the receiver to be encased in resin and for LEDs to light up in response to different predefined user gestures.</p>
                        <p>We decided upon using a Raspberry Pi 4b as the processing unit. This was determined to be necessary over other microcontrollers such as ESP32s because of the processing power required for gesture/image recognition software that we planned to use, as well as its ability to easily interface with high-resolution cameras. The wand was determined to emit an IR signal for tracking by the camera in the receiver as well as include an inertial measurement unit for more complex gestures. Wireless charging for the receiver was chosen to prevent the need for cables poking out of the cube.</p>

                        <p>The first IR test was done with the camera and an IR filter in front of it. The IR LED is attached to a battery pack, forming our first prototype wand. The LED is clearly visible and software was written to trace the path of the wand, which can be seen here. Eventually we would use this basic tracing function to be able to recognize different gestures made by the user. </p>
                        <p>The most challenging part of this was ensuring that the camera remained solely focused on the IR LED and would not attempt to track other features in the environment. Although we have mostly been able to mitigate this as an issue, it can sometimes occur under unique lighting circumstances.</p>

                        <p>In the initial design and testing phase, the team was worried about how heat dissapation would be affected by the electronics being embedded in resin. In order to determine the thermal properties of the resin, we tested the power limits of it. Using a 1â„¦ equivalent ciruit, the resin ended up cracking at 15W of power. This set the upper threshold for power consumption of our system to build around.</p>
                        <p>All components that would be placed in the resin cube were individually tested in resin before the first prototype cube was assembled. The LED strip seen above was one of the components. Although we assumed certain components such as the LEDs would behave normally, we wanted to eliminate risks that would otherwise be hard to find when the entire system was assembled. </p>

                        <p>The IR wand controller required its own programming for sending commands to the cube. We implemented different gesture recognition patterns that would trigger specific light animations when detected by the IR receiver.</p>
